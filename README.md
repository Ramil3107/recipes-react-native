During the development of this application, I got acquainted with React Native. Installed a "naked" setup NOT using Expo GO. 
I got acquainted with the features of navigation and the React Navigation library. I also installed the React Elements library.
This is a simple application with 3 screens which include: the main recipe screen, favorite recipes and information about a specific recipe. 
Implemented logic with likes and searches by name. There is also a tab bar.
